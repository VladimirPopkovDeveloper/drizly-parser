They are then quickly picked and pressed which results in a highly concentrated sugary juice. Canada, Germany, and Austria are the main producers of this type of wine."},{"question":"Where is ice wine made?","answer":"Because the process requires a freezing of the grapes, ice wine needs a colder climate than other wine productions. This type of wine is typically created in Germany, Austria, Slovenia, and Canada. Some countries like Australia use a controversial artificial process to freeze grapes for ice wine."},{"question":"Is ice wine sweet or dry?","answer":"Ice wine is very sweet. The process for creating this dessert wine - leaving the grapes on the vine to freeze - concentrates the grape sugars. Some measurements of sweetness indicate that ice wines can be up to two times sweeter than a soft drink like Coca-Cola. "},{"question":"How much alcohol is in ice wine?","answer":"Ice wine typically doesn’t exceed an alcohol content of 10-12% ABV and can be as low as 6%."},{"question":"Why are ice wines more expensive?","answer":"Frozen grapes have less juice than regular grapes so the process to create an ice wine requires 4-5 times as many grapes. On top of that, it can take anywhere from 3-6 months to ferment the wine and because of the low temperatures required to freeze grapes, this wine is limited to specific regions.

After picking the grapes, we put them in COLD storage (less  than 0 Fahrenheit) and wait until they are frozen very solid. We  press the grapes while they are very frozen, and the initial brix  (sugar measurement) of the juice coming off the press is  between 40 and 50. We use special yeast that can withstand the  very cold temperatures and the high osmotic pressure of the  juice, and we monitor the fermentation carefully. By keeping a  clean and steady fermentation, we maximize the rich fruit  flavors and opulent mouth feel and structure.  Tasting Notes:  This elegant dessert wine is filled with melon overtones,  followed by a mouth filling structure and an ever-lasting finish.  The wine is a blend of Chardonnay, with small amounts of  Gewurztraminer, Riesling, and Vidal. Although rich in sugar,  the acidity provides a pleasing counterpoint, and highlights the  banana and melon flavors.

They are then quickly picked and pressed which results in a highly concentrated sugary juice. Canada, Germany, and Austria are the main producers of this type of wine."},{"question":"Where is ice wine made?","answer":"Because the process requires a freezing of the grapes, ice wine needs a colder climate than other wine productions. This type of wine is typically created in Germany, Austria, Slovenia, and Canada. Some countries like Australia use a controversial artificial process to freeze grapes for ice wine."},{"question":"Is ice wine sweet or dry?","answer":"Ice wine is very sweet. The process for creating this dessert wine - leaving the grapes on the vine to freeze - concentrates the grape sugars. Some measurements of sweetness indicate that ice wines can be up to two times sweeter than a soft drink like Coca-Cola. "},{"question":"How much alcohol is in ice wine?","answer":"Ice wine typically doesn’t exceed an alcohol content of 10-12% ABV and can be as low as 6%."},{"question":"Why are ice wines more expensive?","answer":"Frozen grapes have less juice than regular grapes so the process to create an ice wine requires 4-5 times as many grapes. On top of that, it can take anywhere from 3-6 months to ferment the wine and because of the low temperatures required to freeze grapes, this wine is limited to specific regions.
